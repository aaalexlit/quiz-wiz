    "question": "What is the purpose of pseudonymisation in relation to personal data?",
    "answers": [
      "A. To make the data more accessible to third parties.",
      "B. To increase the value of the data for the data controller.",
      "C. To make the data easier to store and manage.",
      "D. To reduce the risks to the data subjects and help meet data-protection obligations."
    ],
    "rationales": [
      "Incorrect. Pseudonymisation does not aim to make the data more accessible to third parties, but rather to protect the data subjects. See \u201cData Protection and Privacy.\u201d",
      "Incorrect. The purpose of pseudonymisation is not to increase the value of the data for the data controller, but to protect the data subjects. Learning Objective: Understand the principles of data protection and privacy. Review Module 2: \u201cData Protection and Privacy.\u201d",
      "Incorrect. While pseudonymisation may make data easier to manage in some respects, its primary purpose is to protect the data subjects. See \u201cData Protection and Privacy.\u201d",
      "Correct. Pseudonymisation is a data protection measure that reduces the risks to the data subjects and helps data controllers and processors meet their data-protection obligations. Review Module 2: \u201cData Protection and Privacy.\u201d"

    "question": "What is the purpose of plotting a PR curve in precision and recall analysis?",
    "answers": [
      "A. To visualize the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds.",
      "B. To determine the accuracy of the model.",
      "C. To identify the best features for the model.",
      "D. To measure the model's performance on unseen data."
    ],
    "rationales": [
      "Correct. A PR curve is used to visualize the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds. This helps in understanding how the choice of threshold affects the model's performance. Review Module 3: 'Precision and Recall Analysis'.",
      "Incorrect. While accuracy is an important metric, a PR curve specifically visualizes the trade-off between precision and recall, not the overall accuracy of the model. See 'Precision and Recall Analysis'.",
      "Incorrect. A PR curve does not help in identifying the best features for the model. It is used to visualize the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds. Learning Objective: Understand the principles of precision and recall analysis. Review Module 3: 'Precision and Recall Analysis'.",
      "Incorrect. While a PR curve can provide insights into a model's performance, it does not specifically measure the model's performance on unseen data. It visualizes the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds. See 'Precision and Recall Analysis'."
